# AnimatedMap
This is a leaflet map created by me.
In this map, Moving Marker plugin is used to show animated ice cream delivery.
I have modified plugin to synchronize animation of all moving ice cream marker.
Arc.js is used to make curved path.
There are two seperated function. One draws the curved line and another one is moving marker. which both are synchronized.
